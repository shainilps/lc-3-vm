# LC-3 Virtual Machine

I built this for learning purpose. I followed a guide to write the c version vm. read some specs also to implement some of my own.

this is at working state. If you are cursious you can test this in unix machine. (not supported for windows, i haven't included that code)
there is a obj file of 2048 game on the test directory you can play that game.

**commands for c based vm**

```bash
make all
./main test/2048.obj

```

**haskell basd coming soon**
